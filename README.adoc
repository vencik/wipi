Raspberry Pi wireless you-name-it controller
============================================

This project is sort of a template for anyone who wants their RPi to become
a wireless cotroller for... um... anything, really.

WORK IN PROGRES
---------------

It's very premature, now. Working on it..


How it works
------------

Nginx reverse proxy running on the RPi + uWSGI\Flask\wipi application.
The app. backend can be whatever you need; just implement the functionality you
want and expose it over the API...

Then, you can control the back-end device using a web application,
e.g. from your smartphone.
