Raspberry Pi wireless you-name-it controller
============================================

This project is sort of a template for anyone who wants their RPi to become
a wireless cotroller for... um... anything, really.


How does it work
----------------

`Nginx` reverse proxy running on the RPi + `uWSGI`\`Flask`\`wipi` application.
Collection of `wipi.controller.Controller` interface implementations is instantiated
(if allowed in the configuration).
The web app. backend translates API calls to the controllers get/set invocations.

So, you can control the back-end devices from your smartphone or anywhere on your
LAN (or the RPi may act as an AP, creating separate LAN of its own).

Moreover, you may schedule future state changes.
The scheduler supports multiple explicit times of action execution and repetitive
executions after an interval (limited or indefinite) and combinations of both.

The API also has support for down-streaming data, e.g. from sensors.
You may set the stream to get data only from one controller, or from a collection
of them.
The stream is facilitated by using chunked encoding of the HTTP response.

The API has (may have) multiple parallel request/response workers (4 by default),
so it may process multiple requests at once.
But each controller queries are queued and processed in series by the controller,
as each controller has its own, single worker.
(Queries to different controllers are processed in parallel.)
Note that you may choose to start multiple instances of the same controller
(if that makes sense), each with a different name.


Extensibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`wipi` isn't comitted to any particular controller implementation.
Instead, it's a framework that allows addition of any controllers, general or
specialised to particular application.
Each controller may (or may not) be accompanied with its own front-end app
(served by `nginx`).

Put simply, the only thing you need to do to add your own functionality into `wipi`
is to implement the `wipi.controller.Controller` interface (and potentially
create a FE for it).
Then, your functionality shall be available over the `wipi` API.


Prerequisites
-------------

The SW was developed on Raspberry Pi Zero W and ODROID W---so the HW requirements
are indeed minimal.
Recent Raspberry OS or Debian distro is advisable (as always).
On system level, a few actions are required:
* Install `nginx`, `pyenv` and `poetry`. You'll also need `make` for convenience.
* Enable and start `systemd-timesyncd` (if you want to schedule actions at
  distinct times).
  Note that RPi Zero and similar don't have RTC, so you'll need it connected to
  a network with NTP server to keep proper time.
* Make sure the `pi` user can execute system commands via `sudo` without password
  (if you want `wipi` to be able to e.g. shut the system down, restart etc).
* If you use controllers that access system resources such as I2C etc, make sure
  that the `pi` user is in respective system groups (has privileges).
* ... and some more, probably. I'll have to re-do the installation to add all the
  steps---I don't remember all of them, unfortunately. If you use this, feel free
  to update the README and send a pull request, it will be much appreciated.


Front-End
---------

I'm not a FE developer, I can't do it properly.
I never wanted to do FE (I have highest respect to FE developers, but it's just
not my cup of tea).

The FE which comes with `wipi` is just a demo, a starting point for somebody who
could actually do justice to it.
If you'd like to have a go, your contributions shall be, again, much appreciated.
