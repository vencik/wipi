Raspberry Pi wireless you-name-it controller
============================================

This project is sort of a template for anyone who wants their RPi to become
a wireless cotroller for... um... anything, really.

WORK IN PROGRES
---------------

It's very premature, now. Working on it..


How it works
------------

`Nginx` reverse proxy running on the RPi + `uWSGI`\`Flask`\`wipi` application.
Collection of `wipi.controller.Controller` interface implementations is instantiated
(if allowed in the configuration).
The web app. backend translates API calls to the controllers get/set invocations.

So, you can control the back-end devices from your smartphone or anywhere on your
LAN (or the RPi may act as an AP, creating separate LAN of its own).


`systemd` cheatsheat
--------------------

Restart:
----
# systemctl restart wipi
----

Log:
----
# journalctl -elfu wipi
